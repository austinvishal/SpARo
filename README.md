# Description of the Model

Serial-parallel manipulators (S-PMs) have higher stiffness than serial robots and possess the advantages of larger
workspace than PMs. This class of mechanisms has good research and application prospect. SPS+SP PM.
The n(4-SPS+SP) has some merits such as large workspace and high stiffness. It has some potential applications for the robot arms and the serial-PM machine tools
